<h2><u>THE HISTORY OF THE PERSON</u></h2>
<p>If any of you are familiar with the old Cartoon Network show Ed, Edd ‘n’ Eddy you’ve probably heard the fan theory that all the characters in that show are all dead and the show/setting acts a sort of purgatory as each character died in some horrible way and therefore wasn’t able to pass on into the afterlife. This stood out and interests me especially as the show on the surface is just a lighthearted comedy about 3 kids trying to buy a jawbreaker.

Anyway I was wondering if any unassuming Anime series (mainly referring to Rom/Com, Comedy, Slice of Life titles) have a similar sort of fan theory about it.</p>
